# About This Project

## Making it easier for people to gain full access to specialized transportation services

GTFS-eligibilities is a new data standard in development. When complete, it will describe the many factors that can determine access to transit services, particularly specialized transportation services. 

This project will fill a pressing need for a standardized and computer-readable way to describe how a person’s individual characteristics (e.g., age, disability status, residence, employment, or registration in a program) may affect their access to public transportation services. This standard will also describe a transportation provider’s ability to meet a rider’s needs (e.g., whether the provider offers services such as door-to-door service, door-through-door service, stretcher service, mobility device accommodation, and bariatric capability). Such information is currently available to the public in analog or one-off digital formats only. This absence creates a range of unnecessary difficulties:

* Discovering services is labor-intensive, often with the burden falling on riders themselves to figure out what exists and whether they qualify for a specific type of transportation. 
* It’s difficult for transit agencies to communicate their services, especially specialized services, to the public. 
* It also adds barriers to planners, policymakers, and researchers understanding how eligibility factors affect different populations’ mobility.

An expert panel, with members from human services organizations, transit agencies, and transit software developers, will create GTFS-eligibilities as a new draft extension to the GTFS data standard. Once complete, the draft extension will be made available for adoption by implementers and ongoing oversight by the appropriate standards body. 

This project is being carried out by Full Path Transit Technology, under contract with the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT), with funding from the Federal Transit Administration’s [Mobility for All Pilot Program](https://www.transit.dot.gov/funding/grants/grant-programs/mobility-all-pilot-program-grants). The effort is a continuation of ODOT’s ongoing work to support the accessibility and usefulness of transit services through open data and address equity goals laid out in the Oregon Public Transportation Plan.
