# GTFS-eligibilities and -capabilities Project Summary

Under a grant from the Federal Transit Administration’s Mobility for All Pilot Program (M4A), the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) seeks to fill a pressing need for standardized and computer-readable data that describes rider eligibility (characteristics that qualify a rider to use a specialized transportation service; service capability (ability to meet rider needs); and trip purpose eligibility (trip intent matches service requirements). 

To ensure that this effort is worthwhile and that it does not duplicate existing work, ODOT requested that its consultant, Full Path Transit Technology (Full Path), conduct research into completed and in-process efforts to define and enumerate these three areas. There is a well-established transit data standard (the General Transit Feed Specification or GTFS) as well as several “extensions” to the GTFS that expand its utility to the complex world of transportation data. However, this research indicated that no existing efforts address the need for data standards relating to rider eligibility, service capability, and trip purpose eligibility.

To develop an initial proposal for two extensions to the GTFS, Full Path convened an advisory group. This group was made up of experts in the fields of human services transportation, disability advocacy, public transit, data standards development, and transit-related software development to provide input and guidance to this project overall. A Technical Working Group, a subset of the advisory group, worked on the very detailed technical work of developing the proposed standards. 

The project’s budget and timeline required focusing on an achievable result. Accordingly, it was decided that the scope would be limited to the discovery stage of the trip lifecycle, despite early discussions of possibly including registration/booking stages. Another key decision was emphasizing the ease of creating a data feed over completeness and exactness of data. For example, the group determined that it was more important for this early version of GTFS-capabilities to provide service-level information about capabilities, rather than requiring service providers to supply detailed information about every vehicle in their fleet. The advisory group also chose to emphasize flexibility in describing eligibility categories rather than imposition of definitions. The resulting proposal for GTFS-eligibilities introduces Universal Resource Names (URNs) as a structured way of developing unique identifiers for eligibility categories. 

Because this project was intended to be a “solid first step” in the development of GTFS-eligibilities and GTFS-capabilities, several next steps and opportunities were identified:  supporting cross-institutional conversations to develop agreement on common goals and processes; inclusive engagement with riders during the development of applications that use the proposed standards; inclusive governance for the standards that entities that are accountable to the public interest; engaging people and agencies from throughout the world (to get beyond the United States focus of this project); sustained funding for data production and consumption; ongoing development and support around URNs as a concept that is new to the transit world; developing ability to track real-time information about seating area configuration changes through GTFS-capabilities; and support for multiple languages under all scenarios.
