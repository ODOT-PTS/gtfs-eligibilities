# GTFS-eligibilities and GTFS-capabilities

GTFS-eligibilities and GTFS-capabilities are new data standards in development. When complete, they will describe the many factors that can determine access to transit services, particularly specialized transportation services.

These standards will fill a pressing need for a standardized and computer-readable ways to describe rider eligibility and service provider capability. GTFS-eligibilities will deal with how a person’s individual characteristics (e.g., age, disability status, residence, employment, or registration in a program) may affect their access to public transportation services. GTFS-capabilities will describe a transportation provider’s ability to meet a rider’s needs (e.g., whether the provider offers services such as door-to-door service, door-through-door service, stretcher service, mobility device accommodation, and bariatric capability). Such information is currently available to the public in analog or one-off digital formats only. This absence creates a range of unnecessary difficulties:

*   Discovering services is labor-intensive, often with the burden falling on riders themselves to figure out what exists, whether they qualify for a specific type of transportation, and whether a provider can meet their service needs.
*   It’s difficult for transit agencies to communicate about their services, especially specialized services, to the public.
*   It also adds barriers to planners, policymakers, and researchers understanding how eligibility factors and agencies’ ability to provide specialized services affect different populations’ mobility.

An expert panel, with members from human service organizations, transit agencies, and transit software companies, will create proposals for GTFS-eligibilities and GTFS-capabilities as new draft extensions to the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data standard. The panel’s work centers on ensuring that the standards being defined meet the needs of riders and the agencies that serve them, while also being technically sound. Once complete, the draft extensions will be made available for continued refinement and ultimately adoption by implementers and ongoing oversight by the appropriate standards body.

This project is being carried out by Full Path Transit Technology, under contract with the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT), with funding from the Federal Transit Administration’s Mobility for All Pilot Program. The effort is a continuation of ODOT’s ongoing work to support the accessibility and usefulness of transit services through open data and address equity goals laid out in the Oregon Public Transportation Plan. 

On August 25, Kevin Chambers of Full Path Transit Technology presented a webinar this project, sharing project findings and discussing the challenges, how this work will continue, and how it can benefit transit agencies’ in providing specialized transportation services.
