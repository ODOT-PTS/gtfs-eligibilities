# Purpose
A‭ ‬primary‭ ‬goal‭ ‬of‭ ‬the GTFS-eligibilities/GTFS-capabilities project ‬is‭ ‬to‭ ‬be‭ ‬inclusive‭ ‬to‭ ‬the‭ ‬largest‭ ‬number‭ ‬of‭ ‬members,‭ ‬with‭ ‬the‭ ‬most‭ ‬varied‭ ‬and‭ ‬diverse‭ ‬backgrounds‭ ‬possible.‭ ‬As‭ ‬such,‭ ‬we‭ ‬are‭ ‬committed‭ ‬to‭ ‬providing‭ ‬a‭ ‬friendly,‭ ‬safe‭ ‬and‭ ‬welcoming‭ ‬environment‭ ‬for‭ ‬all,‭ ‬regardless‭ ‬of‭ ‬gender,‭ ‬sexual‭ ‬orientation,‭ ‬ability,‭ ‬ethnicity,‭ ‬socioeconomic‭ ‬status,‭ ‬and‭ ‬religion‭ (‬or‭ ‬lack‭ ‬thereof‭)‬.‭

This‭ ‬code‭ ‬of‭ ‬conduct‭ ‬outlines‭ ‬our‭ ‬expectations‭ ‬for‭ ‬all‭ ‬those‭ ‬who‭ ‬participate‭ ‬in‭ ‬our‭ ‬community,‭ ‬as‭ ‬well‭ ‬as‭ ‬the‭ ‬consequences‭ ‬for‭ ‬unacceptable‭ ‬behavior.

We‭ ‬invite‭ ‬all‭ ‬those‭ ‬who‭ ‬participate‭ ‬in‭ the creation of the GTFS-eligibilities standard ‬to‭ ‬help‭ ‬us‭ ‬create‭ ‬safe‭ ‬and‭ ‬positive‭ ‬experiences‭ ‬for‭ ‬everyone.

The “project team” refers to ODOT and its contractor, Full Path Transit Technology. The “expert panel” members will be listed on the site once membership details are confirmed.

3. The expert panel and project team are committed to recognizing and communicating the needs and interests of all participants, including decision makers.
 
4. The expert panel and project team will seek out and facilitate the involvement of those potentially affected by or interested in a decision.
 
5. The project team will seek input from participants in designing how they participate.
 
6. The project team will provide participants with the information they need to participate in a meaningful way.
 
7. The project team will communicate to participants how their input affected the decision.
