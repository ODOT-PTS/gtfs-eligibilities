# Purpose
A‭ ‬primary‭ ‬goal‭ ‬of‭ ‬the GTFS-eligibilities project ‬is‭ ‬to‭ ‬be‭ ‬inclusive‭ ‬to‭ ‬the‭ ‬largest‭ ‬number‭ ‬of‭ ‬members,‭ ‬with‭ ‬the‭ ‬most‭ ‬varied‭ ‬and‭ ‬diverse‭ ‬backgrounds‭ ‬possible.‭ ‬As‭ ‬such,‭ ‬we‭ ‬are‭ ‬committed‭ ‬to‭ ‬providing‭ ‬a‭ ‬friendly,‭ ‬safe‭ ‬and‭ ‬welcoming‭ ‬environment‭ ‬for‭ ‬all,‭ ‬regardless‭ ‬of‭ ‬gender,‭ ‬sexual‭ ‬orientation,‭ ‬ability,‭ ‬ethnicity,‭ ‬socioeconomic‭ ‬status,‭ ‬and‭ ‬religion‭ (‬or‭ ‬lack‭ ‬thereof‭)‬.‭

This‭ ‬code‭ ‬of‭ ‬conduct‭ ‬outlines‭ ‬our‭ ‬expectations‭ ‬for‭ ‬all‭ ‬those‭ ‬who‭ ‬participate‭ ‬in‭ ‬our‭ ‬community,‭ ‬as‭ ‬well‭ ‬as‭ ‬the‭ ‬consequences‭ ‬for‭ ‬unacceptable‭ ‬behavior.

We‭ ‬invite‭ ‬all‭ ‬those‭ ‬who‭ ‬participate‭ ‬in‭ the creation of the GTFS-eligibilities standard ‬to‭ ‬help‭ ‬us‭ ‬create‭ ‬safe‭ ‬and‭ ‬positive‭ ‬experiences‭ ‬for‭ ‬everyone.

The “project team” refers to ODOT and its contractor, Full Path Transit Technology. The “expert panel” members will be listed on the site once membership details are confirmed.

Harassment‭ ‬includes:‭ ‬harmful‭ ‬or‭ ‬prejudicial‭ ‬verbal‭ ‬or‭ ‬written‭ ‬comments‭ ‬related‭ ‬to‭ ‬gender,‭ ‬sexual‭ ‬orientation,‭ ‬race,‭ ‬religion,‭ ‬disability‭; ‬inappropriate‭ ‬use‭ ‬of‭ ‬nudity‭ ‬and/or‭ ‬sexual‭ ‬images‭ ‬in‭ ‬public‭ ‬spaces‭ (‬including‭ ‬presentation‭ ‬slides‭); ‬deliberate‭ ‬intimidation,‭ ‬stalking‭ ‬or‭ ‬following‭; ‬harassing‭ ‬photography‭ ‬or‭ ‬recording‭; ‬sustained‭ ‬disruption‭ ‬of‭ ‬talks‭ ‬or‭ ‬other‭ ‬events‭; ‬inappropriate‭ ‬physical‭ ‬contact,‭ ‬and‭ ‬unwelcome‭ ‬sexual‭ ‬attention.
